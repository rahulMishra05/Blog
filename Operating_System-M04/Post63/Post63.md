# Question on Deadlock | Operaring System - M04 P08

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the forth module which consists of 8 articles.**

_In this article we will see a question based on the concept of deadlock in an operating system, and try to get better understanding of the concept._

***Question:*** Consider a system with `3` processes that share `4` instances of same resource type. Each process can request a max of **K** instances. The largest value of **K** that will always avoid deadlock is?
***Answer:***
- The value of **K = 2**
- The value of k will be two because, if the value of k is one then also no deadlock will occur but question is asking for maximum value.
- If the value of k will be `3` then deadlock will occur. In that case there could be a scenario that `P1` process has `2` instance of resource and want one more while the other two instance of resource are allocated to `P2` and `P3` who also want more instances of resource to get completely execute, in this case what is happening that no process can completes its execution and hence deadlock will occur.
- Therefore the maximum value of K for which deadlock will not occur will be 2.

_So this was all about a simple question on deadlock in an operating system. Hope you liked it and learned something new from it._
