# Deadlock | Operating System - M04 P01

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the forth module which consists of 8 articles.**

_In this article we will discuss about deadlock and ways by which deadlock occurs in detail._

### Deadlock
- If two or more processes are waiting on happening of some event, which never happen then we say these processes are involved in deadlock and then it is known as deadlock.

### Conditions for deadlock are
- Mutual exclusion
- No preemption
- Hold and wait
- Circular wait

1. **Mutual exclusion:** It means that the resource process using should be used in mutual exclusive way. It _(resource)_ should not be used by more than one process at one time.

2. **No pre-emption:** No type/ chance of pre-emption would be there.

3. **Hold and wait:** Process `P1` is holding `R1` resource and waiting for `R2` resource while on the other hand process `P2` is holding `R2` resource and waiting for `R1` resource. `P1` and `P2` should not release any resource, if they do this then deadlock will not happen.

4. **Circular wait:** The above example is an example of circular wait, if there is circular wait, than deadlock can occur. Letâ€™s see another example

***Note: If any one condition is not fulfilled than there may be chances that deadlock do not occur.***

_So this was all about deadlock in an operating system. Hope you liked it and learned something new form it._
