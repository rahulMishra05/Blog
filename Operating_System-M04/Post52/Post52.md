# Multi-Instance Resource Allocation Graph - M04 P03

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the forth module which consists of 8 articles.**

_In the previous article we discussed about resource allocation graph for single instance, now in this article we are going to see about multi-instance resource allocation graph._

Multi-instance resource allocation:
- It means that resource has multiple instances. 
- In simple words we can say that a particular resource can fulfil the need of multiple process requests.

To get a clear understanding of the topic letâ€™s see an example and try to understand.

***Example:***

Process No. | Allocated R1 | Allocated R2 | Request R1 | Request R2 | 
--- |--- | --- | --- | --- |
P1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
P2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
P3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

- Current availability: (0,0)
- With the current availability we can fulfil the request of `P3`, because `P3` is demanding nothing. So, `P3` will get terminated after executing completely. Now the availability has changed as resource allocated to `P3` has been released by `P3`.
- Current availability: (0,1)
- Now, with the current availability we can fulfil the request of `P1`, because it requires `1` resource of `R2` and we have it. So, `P1` will get terminated after getting executed completely and the resource allocated to `P1` will be released.
- Current availability: (1,1)
- With this availability we can fulfil the request of `P2`.
- So, no deadlock is present in the system.
- This example contains circular wait but no deadlock is present, because this is multi-instance that only happen in the case of single-instance.

Process No. | Allocated R1 | Allocated R2 | Allocated R3 | Request R1 | Request R2 | Request R3 |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
P0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 
P1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
P2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
P3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 |

- Current availability: (0,0,1)
- With current availability we can fulfil the request of `P2`, it only require `1` resource of `R3`. It will get terminated and after executing completely.
- Current availability: (0,1,1)
- With current availability we can fulfil the request of `P0`, it require `1` resource of `R2` and `1` resource of `R3`
- Current availability: (1,1,2)
- With current availability we can fulfil the request of `P1` it requires `1` resource of `R1`.
- Current availability: (2,2,2)
- With current availability we can fulfil the request of `P3` it require `1` resource of `R1` and `2` resource of `R2`.
- No deadlock is present in this example.
- Current availability: (2,3,2), all resources are free.

_So this was all about multi-instance resource allocation graph. Hope you liked it and learned something new from it._
