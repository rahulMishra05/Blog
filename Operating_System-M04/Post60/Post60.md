# Question on Deadlock | Operating System - M04 P07

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the forth module which consists of 8 articles.**

_In this article we will see one question based on the concept of deadlock in an operating system._

***Question:*** A system is having 3 processes each requires 2 units of resources **R**. The minimum number of units of **R** requires such that no deadlock will occur?
1. 3
2. 5
3. 6
4. 4

***Answer:***
- **(d) 4 resources** 
- We need `4` resources of `R` because then in worst condition when all the processes request for resource we can give one resource to every process and still one resource will be remaining.
- If we give that resource to any process than it will get terminate because one process require only two resources and when they get that their execution will be complete.
- Now we have two free resources and two processes that need two resources and hence they will also get executed and thus no deadlock will occur.
- If we take `3` resource than deadlock will occur and we are not taking `5` or `6` because we need to find minimum number of resources.

_So this was a simple question on deadlock in an operating system. Hope you liked it and learned something new from it._
