# Banker's Algorithm Question | Operating System - M04 P06

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the forth module which consists of 8 articles.**

_In this article we will see a question on bankerâ€™s algorithm, to get better understanding of the concept._

***Question:*** Check for the deadlock, if deadlock is not present then find the safe sequence.

Process No. | Allocation of E | Allocation of F | Allocation of G | Max need of E | Max need of F | Max need of G | Current availability of E | Current availability of F | Current availability of G | Remaining need of E | Remaining need of F | Remaining need of G | 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
P1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 3	| 0 | 3 | 3 | 0 |
P2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2
P3 | 1 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 0 | 3 | 0
P4 | 2	| 0	| 0	| 5	| 4	| 1	| 6	| 4	| 6	| 3	| 4	| 1

***Answer:***
- Current availability: _(3,3,0)_
- With the current availability we can fulfill the request of `P0`
- Current availability: _(4,3,1)_
- With current availability we can fulfill the request of `P2`
- Current availability: _(5,3,4)_
- With current availability we can fulfill the request of `P1`
- Current availability: _(6,4,6)_
- With current availability we can fulfill the request of `P3`
- `Safe sequence = P0 -> P2 -> P1 -> P3`
- No deadlock will occur. Therefore it is safe.

_So this was a question on bankerâ€™s algorithm. Hope you liked it and learned something new from it._
