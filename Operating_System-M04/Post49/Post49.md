# Resource Allocation Graph in Deadlock | Operating System - M04 P02

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the forth module which consists of 8 articles.**

_In this article we will see that what resource allocation graph in deadlock. In this article we will mainly focus on single instance._

### Resource allocation graph
- How the resources are allocated to process and how the process have been assigned to multiple resource to represent that we use **resource allocation graph** _(RAG)_
- In our system deadlock is present or not, to represent that this is the most suitable way.
- Like any other graph it also has vertex and edges.

- All the processes running in our system are represented as vertex and generally represented as circle.
- All the resources in our system are represented by vertex, but with rectangle box.

- Edges are of two types assign edge. If the arrow is going from resource to process than it means resource is allocated to that process.
- Request edge if arrow is going from process to resource it means process is asking for resource.

Let's see some examples to get better understanding of the concept.

***Example 1:*** Resource `R1` is allocated to process `P1` and `R2` to `P2`, `P1` wants `R2` and `P2` wants `R1`. Check whether there is a deadlock present or not.

We do this kind of representation to check that whether there is a deadlock condition or not.

Another and recommended way to check the presence of deadlock.

Process No. | Allocated R1 | Allocated R2 | Request R1 | Request R2 |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
P1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
P2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

- Current availability: _(0,0)_
- Here `P1` wants one `R2` and `P2` wants one `R1`, but as we can see the availability, we cannot fulfill the request which means that deadlock is present.
- It has circular wait.
- If RAG has circular wait _(cyclic)_, then there will always be deadlock in case of single instance.

***Example 2:*** From the given RAG find out that is deadlock present in this case.

Process No. | Allocated R1 | Allocated R2 | Request R1 | Request R2 |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
P1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
P2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
P3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

- Current availability: _(0,0)_
- We can full fill the availability of `P1` and `P2` because they are not requesting for any resource, so they will get terminated after some time and then the new availability will be.
- Current availability: _(1,1)_
- By this new availability we can fulfill the request of `P3` and then it will also get terminated after execution.
- So, no deadlock is present in this example.
- This is acyclic because by following arrows we cannot come back to that point again.
- If RAG has no cycle then there will be no deadlock in the case of single instance.
