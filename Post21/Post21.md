# CPU Scheduling | Operating System - M02 P02

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the second module which consists of 11 articles.**

_In this article we will see about CPU scheduling and various time related to CPU scheduling._

#### CPU Scheduling
CPU scheduling is a process which allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold (in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc. thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair.

_There are different types of time related to CPU scheduling._

- **Arrival time:**
    - Arrival time is the time at which the process enters the ready queue or state.
    - Arrival time is a particular point of time.
- **Burst time:**
    - Burst time is the time required by a process to get execute on CPU.
    - It is the time duration not point of time.
- **Completion time:**
    - Completion time is the time at which process complete its execution.
    - Completion time is a particular point of time.
- **Turnaround time:**
    - The total time taken by the process to get completely executed is known as turnaround time.
    - > Turnaround time = Completion time - Arrival time.
- **Waiting time:**
    - Waiting time is the time duration at which the process was ideal and was not executing.
    - > Waiting time = Turnaround time - Burst time.
- **Response time:**
    - In how much time CPU responded to a process after its arrival in the CPU is known as response time.
    - > Response time = The time at which process get CPU first time - Arrival time.

_This was all about CPU scheduling and different types of time related to CPU scheduling. Hope you liked this is article and learned something from it._
