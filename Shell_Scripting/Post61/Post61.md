# Sleep and Open Terminal using While Loop | Shell Scripting

**This is a multipart blog article series where I am going to explain the concepts of shell scripting and how to write a shell script in Linux, UNIX or Mac based systems. You can also follow this tutorial blog using windows but for that you have to install a bash from.**

_In this article we will see that how can we use sleep system call using while loop, and how can we open terminal using while loop in shell script._

1. **Sleep command:**
    - If you want to pause the execution of the loop for a while then you can use `sleep` command.
    - Sleep `1` will pauses the execution of the loop for `1` second.
    - ```shell
        n=1
        while [ $n -le 3 ]
        do
            echo "$n"
            (( n++ ))
            sleep(1)
        done
      ```
2. **Open terminal:**
    - We can open the terminal using the while loop in the shell script.
    - In the loop if we write `gnome-terminal &` then the terminal which is present in GNOME desktop will get open.
    - ```shell
      n=1
      while [ $n -le 3 ]
      do
        echo "$n"
        (( ++n ))
        gnome-terminal &
      done
      ```
