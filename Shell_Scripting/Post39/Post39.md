# If Statement | Shell Scripting

**This is a multipart blog article series where I am going to explain the concepts of shell scripting and how to write a shell script in Linux, UNIX or Mac based systems. You can also follow this tutorial blog using windows but for that you have to install a bash from.**

_In this article we will see the syntax of if statement and different types of operators used for doing comparison in between two things using if condition._

### If then syntax
```shell
if condition
then
  statement 
fi
```
### If-else syntax
```shell 
if condition
then
  statement
else
  statement
fi
```
### If-elif syntax
```shell
if condition
then
  statement
elif condition
then 
  statement
else
  statement
fi
```

    - `-eq`: is equal to
    - `-ne`: is not equal to
    - `-gt`: is greater than
    - `-ge`: is greater than or equal to
    - `-lt`: is less than
    - `-le`: is less than or equal to
    - `<` : is less than
    - `<=` : is less than or equal to
    - `>` : is greater than 
    - `>=` : is greater than or equal to
2. **String comparison:**
    - `=` : is equal to
    - `==` : is equal to
    - `!=` : is not equal to
    - `<` : is less than, in ASCII alphabetical order
    - `>` : is greater than, in ASCII alphabetical order
    - `-z` : string is null, that is has zero length
