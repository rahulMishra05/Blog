# Read User Input | Shell Scripting

**This is a multipart blog article series where I am going to explain the concepts of shell scripting and how to write a shell script in Linux, UNIX or Mac based systems. You can also follow this tutorial blog using windows but for that you have to install a bash from.**

_In this article we will see that how can we take user input in shell, and then print them on the screen._

### User input
- `read` command is used to take the input from the user. Like this `read name`
- We store the input in the variable and then we can use that variable wherever we want.
- If we want to take multiple inputs, then we can simply do that by passing multiple variables after read command. Like this `read name1 name2 name3`
- If we want to take the input in the same line in which message is shown, we can do this by this command `read â€“p â€˜<message>â€™ <variable_name>`. We use â€“p flag with read to this.
- If you do not want to show the input user writing on the screen _(silent input)_, just like when you type password, you can use `-sp` flag after `read` to this.
- We can also take the input in the array from the user by using `-a` after read command.
- When we do not write any variable name after the read command, then the input will go inside the built-in variable `REPLY` and we can call it to see or access the data of the input.
