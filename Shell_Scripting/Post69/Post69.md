# Select Loop | Shell Scripting

**This is a multipart blog article series where I am going to explain the concepts of shell scripting and how to write a shell script in Linux, UNIX or Mac based systems. You can also follow this tutorial blog using windows but for that you have to install a bash from.**

_In this article we will see about select loop in shell scripting and how it is used._

- The syntax of **select loop**
```shell
select <variable_name> in list 
do 
    command1
    command2
    commandN
done
```
- The list item will be denoted by different numbers, and to select any specific item from that list you have to enter that number.
- Its structure is similar to for loop but the functionality is different. 
- It will iterate over the list and give us the menu structure.
- We use select loop with case conditions, because in select loop we give choice to the user and in case condition we perform some task based to some choices
