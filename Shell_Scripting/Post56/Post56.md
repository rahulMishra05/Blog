# Case Statement Example | Shell Scripting 

**This is a multipart blog article series where I am going to explain the concepts of shell scripting and how to write a shell script in Linux, UNIX or Mac based systems. You can also follow this tutorial blog using windows but for that you have to install a bash from.**

_In this article we will see an example to get a better understanding on the case statement concepts in shell scripting._

We are going to find that entered character is capital or small
1. First we will ask for the input from the user, with the command `echo ‚Äìe ‚ÄúEnter any character: \c‚Äù`
2. Then we will store that value in a variable, named as **value**
3. Now we will apply case statement, with different cases.
    - **[a-z]:** This means that we are expecting a small alphabet between `a-z`.
    - **[A-Z]:** This means that we are expecting a capital alphabet between `A-Z`.
    - **[0-9]:** This means that we are expecting an integer between `0-9`.
    - **? :** This means that we are expecting any special character. _(Only one special character)_
4. If your program doesn‚Äôt take or recognize the capital alphabets, then just type this command in terminal `LANG=C`

**Final code**
```shell
echo -e "Please enter any character : \c"
read value

case $value in
    [a-z] )
        echo "User enter $value is in between a to z" ;;
    [A-z] )
        echo "User enter $value is in between A to Z" ;;
    [0-9] )
        echo "User enter $value is in between 0 to 9" ;;
    ? )
        echo "User enter $value is a special character" ;;
    * )
        echo "Invalid input, this is maybe because you have entered more than one value." ;;
```

_So this was an example in which we had solved a problem using case statement in shell scripting. Hope you liked it and learned something new from it._
