# Case Statement | Shell Scripting

**This is a multipart blog article series where I am going to explain the concepts of shell scripting and how to write a shell script in Linux, UNIX or Mac based systems. You can also follow this tutorial blog using windows but for that you have to install a bash from.**

_In this article we are going to see that how can we use case statements in shell scripting._

- The case statement can be used as an alternate for if condition.
- The basic syntax of case statement is like this.
```shell
case expression in 
	pattern1 )
		statement ;;
	pattern2 )
		statement ;;
esac
```
- Here the `)` after pattern1 and patter2 means that the case are finished.
- The double semicolon `;;` after statement means that this case is true and completely executed.
- `*)`this is the default case statement.
