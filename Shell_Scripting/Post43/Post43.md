# Append Data in File | Shell Scripting 

**This is a multipart blog article series where I am going to explain the concepts of shell scripting and how to write a shell script in Linux, UNIX or Mac based systems. You can also follow this tutorial blog using windows but for that you have to install a bash from.**

_In this article we will see that how can we append some data at the end of a file using shell script._

1. If we want to add some data at the end of the file, then we can do that in this way.
    - First we will check that file exist or not by this statement `if [ -f $fileName ]`
	- If file exist then we will check that whether that file has write permission or not, and we can do by this command ` if [ -w $fileName ]`
    - If the file has write permission then, we can add some data/text at the end of the file using this command `cat >> $fileName`
    - Remember that if we use `>>` this means that we want to add some data at the end of the file, but if we use `>` after the cat command than it means that we want to overwrite the file.
    - If the file does not have write permission, then we will print that file does not have write permission and program will exit.
    - Similarly, if the file does not exist, then we will print that file does not exist and program will exit.

***Note:*** _To remove the write permission from the file we can write this command `chmod â€“w <file_name>`, and if we want to give write permission to the file then we will write this command `chmod +w <file_name>`_
