# For Loop to Execute Commands | Shell Scripting 

**This is a multipart blog article series where I am going to explain the concepts of shell scripting and how to write a shell script in Linux, UNIX or Mac based systems. You can also follow this tutorial blog using windows but for that you have to install a bash from.**

_In this article we are going to see that how we can use bash commands in shell script with the help of for loop._

- We can use _for loop_ to execute commands, like this.
```shell
for <variable_name> in ls pwd date
do
    echo "----------$<variable_name>----------"
    $<variable_name>
done
```
- In this example first `ls` command will get executed then `pwd` command and in last `date` command.
- Letâ€™s solve another problem we have to print the name of all directories present in any folder using for loop.
```shell
for <variable_name> in *
do
    if [ -d $<variable_name> ]
    then 
        echo $<variable_name>
    fi
done
```
- Here `*` will go through each file and every file present in that directory.
- If condition will check that whether that file is a directory or not, if it is a directory than its name get printed.
