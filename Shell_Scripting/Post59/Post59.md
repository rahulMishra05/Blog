# While Loop | Shell Scripting

**This is a multipart blog article series where I am going to explain the concepts of shell scripting and how to write a shell script in Linux, UNIX or Mac based systems. You can also follow this tutorial blog using windows but for that you have to install a bash from.**

_In this article we will learn about while loop. How to use while loop and what are itâ€™s functionalities._

- The syntax of while loop
```shell
while [condition]
do
	command1
	command2
	command3
done
```

- If we want to increment the value of the variable we can do that in this way `n=$(( n+1 ))` or `(( n++ ))` or `(( ++n ))`
- First the condition we be checked in the while loop. If the condition is true than the part written after do will be executed.
- It will execute till the condition becomes false.
- And at last `done` means that while loop has ended.
