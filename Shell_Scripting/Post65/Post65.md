# For Loop | Shell Scripting

**This is a multipart blog article series where I am going to explain the concepts of shell scripting and how to write a shell script in Linux, UNIX or Mac based systems. You can also follow this tutorial blog using windows but for that you have to install a bash from.**

_In this article we are going to understand for loop in shell scripting._

1. The syntax for loop. There are many ways to write the for loop.
    - First way
        ```shell
        for <variable_name> in 1 2 3 4 5 . . N
        do
            command1
            command2
            command3
        done
        ```
    - Second way
        ```shell
        for <variable_name> in file1 file2 file3
        do
            command1 on $<variable_name>
            command2
            commandN
        done
        ```
    - Third way
        ```shell
        for <variable_name> in $(Linux-Or-Unix_Command_Here)
        do
            command1 on $<variable_name>
            command2 on $<variable_name>
            commandN
        done
        ```
    - Forth way
        ```shell
        for (( EXP1; EXP2; EXP3 ))
        do
            command1
            command2
            command3
        done
        ```
2. We can give the range to iterate like this `{1..10}`. Here the range is from `1` to `10`
3. If we want to specify increment than we can do that in this way `{1..10..2}`. Here the range is from `1` to `10` and increment will be of `2`
4. You can use the above methods only if your bash version is above `4.0`. You can check you bash version by this command `echo ${BASH_VERSION}`
