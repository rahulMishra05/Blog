**This is a multipart blog article series where I am going to explain the concepts of shell scripting and how to write a shell script in Linux, UNIX or Mac based systems. You can also follow this tutorial blog using windows but for that you have to install a bash from.**

_In this article we are going to discuss about until loop._

1. Until loop are slightly different from while loop.
2. Syntax of while loop and until loop is same, but the functionality wise both are opposite. 
3. Syntax of until loop
    ```shell
    until [ condition ]
    do
        command1
        command2
        command3
    done
    ```
4. The difference between while loop and until is that, in while if the condition is true than only commands get executed. While on the other hand in the, until loop if the condition is false then only commands will get executed.
