# Floating Point Operations | Shell Scripting

**This is a multipart blog article series where I am going to explain the concepts of shell scripting and how to write a shell script in Linux, UNIX or Mac based systems. You can also follow this tutorial blog using windows but for that you have to install a bash from.**

_We cannot solve floating point numbers using simple arithmetic operations. So in this article we will see that how we solve floating point numbers._

We cannot perform arithmetic operations on decimal using previous methods, it will give an error. For that we use `bc` which stands for basic calculator.
- We can use bc command in this way `echo ‚Äú20.5+5‚Äù | bc`
- But there is a problem with division that it will not show the values after decimal. So to remove that we have to define a variable scale like this `echo ‚Äúscale=2;20.5+5‚Äù | bc`
- Here we can see the value till `2` decimal places.
- We can also solve/calculate square root of some number and can also solve trigonometric equations using the `bc` keyword.
- If you want to use variables then the syntax becomes `echo ‚Äú$<variable_name1>+$<variable_name2>‚Äù | bc`. Here num1 and num2 are variables which have some value in it.
- We can calculate the square root of a number in this way `echo ‚Äúscale=2;sqrt($<variable_name>)‚Äù | bc -l`
- To calculate we have to use a function called sqrt and pass the variable name to it, whose square root we want to calculate.
- But sqrt function is a math function and we need to call. To call math function we use `-l` command.
- We can also calculate power of any number like this `echo ‚Äúscale=2;3^3‚Äù | bc -l`
- You can get more information about `bc` command by just typing `man bc` in terminal.
