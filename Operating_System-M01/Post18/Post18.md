# Process v/s Threads | Operating System - M01 P11

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the first module which consists of 12 articles.**

_In this article you will the difference between **Process** and **Threads** in an operating system. Here, we are talking about **multiprocessing/ multitasking** environment._

Letâ€™s take a general overview about both things. A process is a heavy weight task while a thread is a light weight task.

We will see the difference in between these with the help of a table.

Process | Thread |
---| --- |
In process we fork the process, and by it a duplicate process starts, which has its own `Data`, `code`, `stack` and `register` ![Untitled Diagram.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605527872948/lSN96Lf9J.png)| In thread, if we create multiple threads of a task, then both threads will share he `data`, `code` while they have their own `stack` and `registers`. ![Untitled Diagram (1).png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605527884640/lAdRNjumd.png)|
System calls are involved in process _(e.g. fork)_. Here operating system/kernel is responsible for making multiple processes. |There is no system call involved _(generally at user level)_. Here user or the API is responsible for making multiple threads. |
Operating system treats different processes differently. | All user level threads are treated as single level for operating system. |
Different processes have different copies of data, file, and code. | Threads share same copy of code and data. |
Context switching is slow. | Context switching is faster. |
Blocking a process will not lock the other process. | Blocking a thread will block entire thread. | 
Independent in nature. | Interdependent in nature. Because they share memory and address. | 

_So, this was difference between **process** and **thread**. Hope it helped you and you learn something new._
