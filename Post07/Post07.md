***Database System :*** Every organization whether private or government, have a big chunk of data and they have to maintain the data, in order to use it in future or for any other task like statics etc. To store this huge chunk of data every organization has their own database system.

1. **Database :** If I have to explain you the meaning of database in simplest manner then I will say that _Database is a collection of related data._ Technically the database is future divided into three categories _structured_, _semi-structures_ and _unstructured._ We will discuss about structured and unstructured data because they are main and mostly concerned.
    - ***Structured Database :*** Structured database means that the database in which we can store data in a particular shape or structure. It is done with the help of a concept that is known as _RDBMS_ (Relational Database Management System). We store the structured data in the form of relation/table.
        - _Example :_ Database of Indian Railways.
    - ***Unstructured Database :*** Unstructured database means that the database in which we do not store the data in any structured format.
        - _Examples :_ Webpages.
2. **DBMS :** Now as we had stored the data in a structured manner, then we also want to perform some operations on that data in order to use it, these operations can be _write_, _delete_ or _update_. So, in order to perform these operations DBMS comes into play. DBMS provides us the way to manage the data by performing different types of operations on it.
    - Different companies had made different-different DBMS the most common examples of DBMS are _SQL Server_, _Oracle_, _MySql_ and _DB2_.

***Note : At present almost 90% of the data is stored in unstructured form.***
