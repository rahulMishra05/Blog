#User Level v/s Kernel Level Threads | Operating System - M01 P12

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the first module which consists of 12 articles.**

_In this article you will the difference between **User level** and **Kernel level** threads in an operating system. Here, we are talking about **multiprocessing/multitasking** environment._

Remember one thing that, user level thread and kernel level thread always share code, file and data while they have different stack and registers, thatâ€™s why these are known as _Light weight processes._

We will see the difference in between these with the help of a table.

User level thread | Kernel level thread |
--- | --- |
User level threads are managed by user level libraries. It means that it is the responsibility of application to create user level thread. | Kernel level threads are managed by operating system. We have to use system calls for it. |
User level threads are typically fast. | Kernel level threads are slower then user level threads. |
Context switching is faster. | Context switching is slower. |
If one user level thread performs blocking operations then entire process get blocked. | If one kernel level thread blocked, no affect on others.

### Hybrid environment

- At present we use hybrid environment, which means that we have both user level thread and kernel level thread.
- Generally we use two user level threads and map it with one kernel level thread.
- We can map it by using _many to one_, _one to many_, _many to many_ method. Just like Linux base operating system in general use _one to one_ method, to map user level thread and kernel level thread.

_This was all about kernel level thread and user level thread. Hope you liked it and learned something new from it._
