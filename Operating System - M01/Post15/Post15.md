# Fork System Call | Operating System - M01 P08

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the first module which consists of 12 articles.**

_In this article I am going to explain about ‚Äúfork‚Äù system call. We will see some examples of implementation of fork system call to get a better understanding of the concept._

### Fork
- Fork is a system call.
- It comes under _process control system call_.
- We use fork system call to make child process.
- Suppose, we have a C program, if we write `fork()` in it then a child process will be created. This child process also has its unique ID.
- We use the concept of fork, because let‚Äôs assume that the parent process is busy, so a clone will be created which will perform the task which parent process is unable to complete/execute. _(Another approach to solve this problem and it is known as `Thread` it is somewhat different from fork.)_
- Fork system call generally returns two value 0 and +1 (+ve). 0 denotes child process while +ve denotes parent process. -1 can also be created this happen when due to some reasons child process cannot be created, for example in case operating system/kernel is busy.
- Let us take an example to understand about fork system call.

```c
main() {
fork();
    printf("Hello");
}
```

In this case two process are running parallel, due to the fork statement.

Here `Hello` will be printed two times because, before the execution of the `printf` statement, the fork statement will be executed and a child process is created.

The id of child process is 0, while the id of parent process is +1 (+ve)

- Let‚Äôs see one more example; this will help you to understand the concept of fork system call more clearly.
```c
main() {
fork();
fork();
    printf("Hello");
}
```

In this case at the time of 2nd fork **C1** and **P** will behave as a parent. Therefore the following output will be obtained as shown in diagram.
Here `Hello` will be printed 4 times.

-  Total number of execution = 2<sup>n</sup>
- Total number of child process = 2<sup>n</sup>-1
- n stands for **number of fork commands.**

_This was all about the fork system call, hope you likes it and learn something new from it._
