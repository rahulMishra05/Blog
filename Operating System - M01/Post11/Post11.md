# Different Types of Operating System | Operating System - M01 P04

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series i am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple module and this is the first module which consists of 12 articles.**

_In this article we are going to know more about different types of operating system. We will discuss about **Real Time**, **Distributed**, **Clustered** and **Embedded** operating system._

1. **Real Time operating system:**
    - In real time operating system ***time*** constraint is present, which means the desired output of the process should be delivered in real time it cannot be delayed, _YouTube live_ is an example of real time output.
    - Real time operating system are further divides into two categories _hard_ and _soft_.
    - Hard real time operating systems means that at any cost we cannot bear any sort of delay in getting the output, time constraints have to be followed strictly.
        - Missile system, flight simulation etc.
    - Soft real time operating system means that we need output at this moment but we can tolerate very short delay.
        - Game play, YouTube live etc.
2. **Distributed operating system:**
    - In this operating system the machines are present in loosely coupled environment, which means that the machines are present in different geographical locations.
    - These machine connect with other machines via a network.
    - You can understand it in this way, _Blockchain_ technology uses same concept, and in that the servers are connected to each other via blockchain protocol or you can say that they follow blockchain protocol.
    - And all these machines act as a single operating system.
    - So, to manage this environment the operating system used is known as ***Distributed operating system.***
3. **Clustered operating system:**
    - Clustered operating system are just opposite of distributed operating system, here all the different machines are connected to a local network.
    - As different machines having their own hardware connected to a local network it acts like a server or you can say as a super computer.
    - The computation power of different machines will be combined, resulting a total increase in power of computation for a single system.
    - So, to manage this environment the operating system used is known as ***Clustered operating system.***
4. **Embedded operating system:**
    - Embedded devices are the electronic devices which perform only a specific task like _microwave_, _A.C_, etc.
    - The operating system used in these types of devices is known as embedded operating system.
    - We cannot change the functionality of these devices, means we cannot re-program a microwave to wash clothes.

This was all about different types of operating system, these operating system we discussed above are also used by us on daily basis.
