**The average attention span of a normal person is 8 seconds, so
it is really important that your website is attractive in decent way,  that the user like and continue to stay on it, and in order to do you need to be quite good in CSS. Let's see how can you master/upgrade your CSS skills.**

### **CSS ** 
You all know that CSS has a very important role in the website. As `HTML` provides the structure of the web page, `CSS` provides layouts (visual and aural) for a variety of devices. So, it becomes very important for a web developer to spend time on styling his/her website to give it a decent look, but if you do this by using pure CSS (by writing everything by your own) it would be very difficult, time consuming and painful.

**Then how can we save our precious time and build a decent looking web page ?**

The answer for this question is by using _CSS Frameworks_ 

You can understand the term `Framework` as it provides a foundation on which software developers can build programs for a specific platform.

_Let's dive in and explore some of the most popular and common CSS frameworks, which will make your life a lot easier._

1. **Bootstrap :-** Bootstrap is the most popular CSS framework among the developers, and this is because it is very easy to learn and masetr, plus the development of website become very much faster. \
The reason it is the most used framework because of it's pre-written classes, to give you an overview suppose you want to add a button then in `HTML` file you just have to decalare a class `btn` inside the button tag, and boom !! It's done. \
`<button class="btn">Programming Port</button>`

**Note one thing that you have to add your custom CSS in   your website to achive a decent looking website. If you use less custom CSS and rely more on the framework for styling then it is more likely that your website somehow looks similar to other websites.**

**Keep in mind that CSS framework is used only to speed-up your development process.**

There are many more frameworks which I had not mentioned here, that doesn't mean that they are bad or you should not use them.

No, that's not the case. The frameworks mentioned here are popular framewroks right now, they have good documentation and they are quiet easy to learn and master in order to give a decent look to your website.

But is is highly recommended that you should use the framework according to your requirement, _for example : if you want to develop a website very quickly then go with `Bootstrap`, if you want to give a classy and smooth look to your website then use `Materialize CSS` and if you do not want to write entire CSS by yourself but want it to be customized entirely according to you then my recommendation is that you should use `Tailwind`_

Remember one thing that you have to choose a framework according to the use-case, this is best and recommended way in any development practice.

> I hope that this article be helpful for you, and will help you to choose your next CSS framework.
