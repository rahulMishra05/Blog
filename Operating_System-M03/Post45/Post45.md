# Question on Binary Semaphore | Operating System - M03 P07

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the third module which consists of 10 articles.**

_In this we will see a question on binary semaphore and try to understand the concept of binary semaphore._

***Question:*** What is the maximum number of processes that may present in critical section at any point of time?

_Each process from P1-P9 will execute this code_
```c
repeat
    p(mutex)
    critical section
    v(mutex)
forever
```
_Process P10 will execute this code_
```c
repeat
    v(mutex)
    critical section
    v(mutex)
forever
```
**The initial value of mutex = 1**
**All processes P1-P10 are cooperative process**

***Answer:***
- Here, when `P1` try to enter the critical section then it will run the first code. After executing the code the it get successfully and enter critical section. Now as the value of **mutex** is `0` no other process can enter the critical section if they try to enter they will be sent to suspended list and get blocked.
- This is happening because, to enter the critical section, they have to execute the `P()` operation which reduce the value of mutex from `1` to `0`, but the value of mutex is already `0` as `P1` has earlier executed it.
- So process from `P2- P9` cannot enter the critical section, while `P1` is there.
- Now, we will try to send `P10` in the critical section, for that `P10` will execute second code, and in that `v()` operation will make value of mutex from `0` to `1` and thus successfully get inside the critical section. Now, we have `P1` and `P10` in the critical section with the value of mutex `1`.
- And again `P2` will try to enter the critical section, but because now the value of mutex is `1` it will successfully get inside of critical section.
- Now we have `P1`, `P10` and `P2` inside the critical section. And all the other processes from `P3-P9` cannot enter the critical section.
- **BUT THIS IS WRONG ANSWER.**
- We can do one thing, if `P10` exit the critical section then the value of mutex will become `1` and `P3` can enter the critical section, now mutex value is `0`, we will execute the second code and again the `P10` will enter the critical section. Thus now we have four processes inside the critical section _(P1, P2, P3 and P10)_.
- This will keep happening and at the end we will have `10` process inside the critical section, and all of this is happening because `P10` code has `v()` operation at the entry section. And we know that `v()` operation increase the value from `0` to `1` and if it is `1` then it remains `1`.

**Therefore, the final answer is `10` processes _(P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, and P10)_**

_So this was all about question on binary semaphore. Hope you liked it and learned something new from it._
