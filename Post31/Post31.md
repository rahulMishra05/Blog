# Process Synchronization | Operating System - M03 P01

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the third module which consists of 10 articles.**

_In this article we will the basic concepts of process synchronization. We will see an example and try to understand the basic of process synchronization and how it is achieved._

***Process synchronization:*** There are two types of process 
1. **Cooperative process:**
    - In this kind of process execution of one process will cause some changes on other process.
    - This happens because they may have something in common or share something; it could be _variable, memory or buffer, code, resources (CPU, printer, and scanner)_.
2. **Independent process:**
    - In this kind of process execution of one process does not affect any other process, because they do not share anything or have anything in common.

Letâ€™s see an example and try to understand the concept the process synchronization. Here both the programs share a variable named **shared** and in this case we are talking about uni-processor system.

`int shared = 5;`

**P1**
```c
int x = shared;
x++;
sleep(1);
shared = x;
```

**P2**
```c
int y = shared;
y--;
sleep(1);
shared = y;
```
- As mentioned earlier we are talking about uniprocessor system.
- We will execute `P1` program first, you can also execute `P2` first.
- When we execute the `P1` program the value of shared get sorted/copied into a variable `x`.
- Then value of `x` is incremented by one and it becomes `6` from `5`.
- For `1` second `P1` process will be stop executing _(due to `sleep(1);`)_ command, when `P1` get paused CPU will not pause rather CPU will start executing `P2` _(CPU will perform context switching by saving the details of `P1` in PCB which stands for process control block.)_
- Context switching is possible in this case because there is a process in parallel.
- Now, `P2` will start executing and value of shared variable which is `5` gets stored in a variable `y`.
- Now the value of `y` will become `4` after executing the command `y--`.
- After that `P2` will also get sleep for `1` second because of the same reason that was present in the `P1` program and is `sleep(1)`
- Now, CPU will start executing `P1` from weâ€™re it was paused.
- The value of `x` variable is `6` so according to the code we will load the value in shared variable.
- Now the value in shared variable is `6`. And the program `P1` will get terminate.
- Now again `P2` will start executing from the sate it was paused.
- Here the value of `y` is `4` and the same will get load in the shared variable.
- Now the value of shared variable is `4`.
- But this is wrong answer because we are adding `1` in a value and subtracting `1` from that so the value of variable should not change but here the value of variable is changing.
- This is because both the processes are sharing something so they are cooperative processes but they are not synchronized if they were synchronized then this problem will not occur.
- This problem is known as **Race condition**, and thatâ€™s why we need process synchronization.

**So, in conclusion we can say that whenever two or more cooperative process run then a problem will occur known as race condition.**

_This was all about **process synchronization**. Hope you liked it and learned something new from it._
