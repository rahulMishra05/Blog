# Example of Mix Burst Time (CPU & I/O Both) | Operating System - M02 -09

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the second module which consists of 11 articles.**

_In this article we will see a question in mix burst, which means that the process will access CUP and then perform some I/O operation._

### Mix burst time
- The mode is pre-emptive.
- A criterion is pre-emptive.

_Let us understand about mix burst time scheduling with an example. We have to complete this table by solving this question by using gantt chart._

Process No. | Arrival time | Priority | CPU | I/O | Completion time |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
P1 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 5 | 3 | | 
P2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | |
P3 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 1 | | 
P4 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | |

***Lower the number higher the priority.***

Before solving this question you need to keep few points in mind.
- We have to find the completion time of every process.
- The preemption of the processes are related to the priority.

- So, at time unit 0 process `P1` arrives at CPU and get executed for `1` unit of time, because after `1` unit of time it has to perform I/O operation for `5` unit of time.
- As, `P1` got preempted at time unit `1` and next process `P2` arrives at time unit `2` thatâ€™s why CPU remain idle for `1` unit of time.
- `P2` arrive at CPU at time unit `2`, but got executed for only `1` unit of time because `P3` arrives at time unit `3` and have higher priority than `P2`.
- `P3` starts its execution and got executed for `2` unit of time and then to perform I/O operation it got preempted.
- `P2` and `P4` are present in ready queue but P2â€™s priority is higher than that of P4â€™s priority so `P2` starts its execution. When `P2` executed for `1` unit for time at that time P1â€™s I/O operation got completed.
- So, `P2` got preempted as `P1` has higher priority and P1â€™s execution got started. 
- `P1` got executed for `2` units of time and then the I/O operation of `P3` got completed so `P1` got preempted.
- `P3` got terminated after executing for `1` unit of time. And `P1` again start executing, after executing for `1` unit of time it also gets terminated.
- Again `P2` has higher priority so P2â€™s execution started and after executing for `1` unit of time `P2` got preempted to perform I/O operation.
- `P4` is the only process remaining in the ready queue so its execution starts and after `2` unit of time `P4` get preempted to perform I/O operation. 
- CPU will remain idle as `P2` and `P4` are busy in I/O for `1` unit of time.
- P2â€™s I/O is completed so it got executed for `1` unit of time and got terminated.
- Then again as only `P4` is remaining and that too is busy in I/O, CPU will remain idle for `2` unit of time.
- When P4â€™s I/O completed it got executed for `1` unit of time and then terminated.

All the processes are now completed. Now we will find the completion time of each process.

Process No. | Arrival time | Priority | CPU | I/O | CPU | Completion time |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
P1 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 5 | 3 | 10 | 
P2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 15 |
P3 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 9 | 
P4 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 18 |

_Some observations from the table._
- `Ratio of CPU idleness = 4/18`
- `Ratio of CPU usage = 14/18`

_So, this was all about **mix burst time** scheduling. Hope you like it and learned something new from it._
