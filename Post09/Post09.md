# Batch Operating System | Operating System - M01 P02

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the first module which consists of 12 articles.**

In this article we will see that what are the types of operating system and mainly focus on **Batch Operating System.**

### Types of operating systems : 
There are in total seven types of operating systems and their names are.
- Batch
- Multiprogrammed
- Multitasking
- Real time OS
- Distributed
- Clustered
- Embedded

### Batch Operating System :
This operating system was mainly used in 1960s and only few companies or organizations have computer systems at that time _(NASA. ISRO)_ \
These organizations use to load their jobs/task on **Punch cards/ Paper tape/ magnetic tape,** and give it to the operator, then operator use to converts these punch cards into different batches _(that means batches of similar kind, which have similar kind of process.)_ Now we get different batches let say B1, B2, B3 etc. after this these batches were given to CPU.\
Now while execution of the process, a scenario may occur in which the process wants to perform some Input/output operation, so in order to do that CPU stop executing that process, until that process completes its I/O operation, but there is a problem that during I/O operation of the process the CPU becomes **Ideal** which was the biggest disadvantage of Batch operating system.\
This operating system was basically a non-pre-emptive operating system, which means if the CPU starts executing a process it will execute it completely, no other process can be executed by it in the mean time _(in simple words it was unable to do multi-processing, which almost every operating system nowadays is capable of)_. This was all about ***Batch Operating System***
