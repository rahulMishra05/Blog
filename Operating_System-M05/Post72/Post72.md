# Various Allocation Methods in Contiguous Memory Management | Operating System - M05 P05

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the fifth module which consists of 26 articles.**

_In this article we will see various methods for allocation in primary memory in contiguous memory management system._

1. **First-fit:** 
    - Allocate the first hole that is big enough.
    - In it searching time is less.
    - Fast and simple to implement.
2. **Next-fit:** 
    - Same as first-fit but start search always from last allocated hole.
    - Search time is more than first-fit, as it has to search for the last hole that was filled.
3. **Best-fit:**
    - Allocate the smallest hole that is big enough.
    - It will search the entire list, thatâ€™s why it is slow.
    - It will allocate the process to that hole which will have the minimum internal fragmentation.
4. **Worst-fit:**
    - Allocate the process to the largest hole.
    - It will always search the entire list thatâ€™s why it is slow.

_So this was all about various allocation methods in contiguous memory management system. Hope you liked it and learned something new from it._
