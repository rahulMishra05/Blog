# Memory Management Techniques | Operating System - M05 P02

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the fifth module which consists of 26 articles.**

_In this article you will get a basic understanding about memory management techniques and why memory management techniques are required in an operating system._

### Memory management technique
- The main motive of memory management technique is to place maximum number of process in RAM _(ready state)_.
- By that the degree of multiprogramming will increase.
- We try to keep degree of multiprogramming high, because whenever CPU tends to become idle then we have a lot of process available in ready state to get executed.
- By this we try to maximize the utilization of the CPU.

- In contiguous allocation the processes are allocated in memory in contiguous manner.
- In non contiguous allocation the processes are allocated in memory in non-contiguous manner.

_So this was a brief explanation about memory management techniques, we will see about each topic in dept in next few articles. Hope you liked it and learned something new form it._
