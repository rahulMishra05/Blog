# Question on Contiguous Memory Management | Operating System - M05 P06

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the fifth module which consists of 26 articles.**

_In this article we are going to see a question based on various allocation methods in contiguous memory management, so we can get a better understanding of the concept._

***Question:*** Request from process are 300 KB, 25 KB, 125 KB, 50 KB respectively, the above request could be satisfied with

1. Best-fit but not first-fit
2. First-fit but not best-fit
3. Both 
4. None

***Answer:***
- `(ii)` _First-fit but not best-fit_
- If we allocate process according to the concept of first-fit than all the process will get place, like this

- But if we use best-fit concept to allocate the process into the RAM, then the structure of the RAM will look like this.

- Here we cannot put `50 KB` process _(`P4`)_ in RAM due to external fragmentation. This is because in contiguous memory allocation we cannot divide process into different fragments.

_So this was a simple question on various allocation methods in contiguous memory management. Hope you liked it and learned something new from it._
