# Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation | Operating System - M05 P08

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the fifth module which consists of 26 articles.**

_In this article we are going to see about non-contiguous memory allocation, that how it works, its pros and cons._

### Non-contiguous memory allocation
- In contiguous memory allocation a process cannot span at different memory location, but here we can divide the process and allocate different parts of memory to it.
- External fragmentation is a problem which is present in contiguous memory allocation, can be removed by using the concept of non-contiguous memory allocation.

- Here we are dividing a process into small fragments _(parts)_ and then allocating them to different parts of RAM, by this we are removing the problem known as external fragmentation.
- We have a problem with this approach, that the holes in the RAM are created dynamically which means their value; size and location keep on changing. So we have to analysis the RAM and divide the process, only then we can place/ put process inside memory _(RAM)_, but this is the problem because this whole process require time and it is not time efficient.
- So to overcome this problem we divide the processes into multiple parts before it comes into the main memory _(RAM)_, and this divided section is known as **page**.
- We are doing partition in secondary memory.
- On the other hand we also divide the main memory _(RAM)_ and these section is known as **frame**

- Process will be divided into **pages** and main memory _(RAM)_ will be divided into **frames**.
- `Page size = Frame size`
- This is because than page will fit in frame easily.

_So this was all about non-contiguous memory allocation. Hope you liked it and learned something new from it._
