**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the fifth module which consists of 26 articles.**

_In this article we will see about inverted paging, we will see that what is the need of inverted paging and why it is used._

### Inverted paging
- In normal paging each process has its own page table and page table is present in main memory.
- So some place in main memory is used to store the page table and it is not good.
- In inverted paging instead of making page table for every process we make a global page table.
- Number of entries in global page table will be equal to total number of frame number in main memory.
- There is a problem in inverted paging that its searching time is more.
- While it uses less memory than normal paging because of the use of global page table.

_So this was a brief description about inverted paging. Hope you liked it and learned something new form it._
