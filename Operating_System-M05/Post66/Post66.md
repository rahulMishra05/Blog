# Memory Management and Degree of Multiprogramming | Operating System - M05 P01

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the fifth module which consists of 26 articles.**

_In this article we are going to know about memory management in operating system and degree of multiprogramming._

### Memory management
- Memory management in operating system means that it is a method/ functionality to manage different types of memory.
- Mainly memory management is method of managing primary memory or RAM.

### Degree of multiprogramming
- CPU is not connected with secondary memory directly because the speed of secondary memory is very low in comparison of CPU.
- All the process/ programs are present in secondary memory, in order to execute them we have to load them in RAM
- From RAM they will be sent to CPU and get executed.
- This is called degree of multiprogramming.
- Multiprogramming means, try to place more and more processes from secondary memory to primary memory. Because then only the utilization of CPU will be at satisfactory level.
- If we increase the number of process in RAM than CPU utilization will be more and degree of multiprogramming will be also high.

_So this was a brief explanation of memory management and degree of multiprogramming in an operating system. Hope you liked it and learned something new from it._
