# Thrashing | Operating System - M05 P16

**This is a multipart blog article series, and in this series I am going to explain you the concepts of operating system. This article series is divided into multiple modules and this is the fifth module which consists of 26 articles.**

_In this article we will see that what is thrashing? Why it is used and what are the problems thrashing has and also how can be solve those problems._

### Thrashing
- We divide process into multiple pages and load them in RAM. Our main focus is to increase degree of multiprogramming so CPU utilization can also increase.
- One way to do this is we can load one page of every process in RAM so degree of multiprogramming would be highest.
- But there is a problem with this approach that suppose CPU request a page from `P1` process which is not present in RAM than it will be termed as **page fault** and there could be a worst case scenario that RAM is full with different pages of different processes but CPU call a page which is not present in RAM.
- In this scenario to recover from page fault a large amount of time is required, and during that time CUP utilization will also decrease.

- When the system is recovering from page fault and CPU utilization is less that is known as thrashing.
- We can remove thrashing when we use long term scheduler.

_So this was all about **thrashing**. Hope you liked it and learned something new from it._
